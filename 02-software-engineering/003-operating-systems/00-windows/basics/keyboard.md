# Insert Mode and Overwrite Mode

- If the cursor is set to verticle line(|), Then it is in ***insert*** mode.
    - It is the default mode
    - All text you type will force the rest of the line to move further.

- If the cursor is set to an underscore (_), Then it is in ***overwrite*** mode.
    - It is enabled by pressing the `Insert` key.
    - meaning that anything you type will overwrite the text at the cursor position.

- Generally this is altered when 0 is pressed when NumLock is disabled, which enables `Insert` mode! 

- `Insert` key toggles the modes!
