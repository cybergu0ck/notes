# Choke

Choke is a valve that "chokes" the engine by limiting the air supply thus enriching the air-fuel ratio (fuel rich mixture).

## Need for a choke

- Choke is needed to start the engine on a cold day, when the engine needs a fuel rich mixture to start.
- Choke is needed to start old engines.

## How does temperature affect the engine.

- On standard conditions, the energy from the burning of the fuel in the engine can be used directly.
- On colder conditions, the engine itself will absorb some energy (because thermodynamics) hence more energy is required than standard contions to get the engine running.
