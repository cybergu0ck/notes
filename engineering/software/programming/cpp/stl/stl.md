# STL

- A library of powerful, reusable, adaptable, generic classes and functions.
- It is implemented using C++ templates.
- It implements common data structures and algorithms.
- STL has 3 main components:

  1. **Containers** : Collection of objects or primitive types (array, vector, deque, stack, set, map etc).

     - Types of containers provided by STL are:
       1. Sequence containers : array, vector, list, forward_list, deque
       1. Associative containers : set, multi set, map, multi map
       1. Container adapters : stack, queue, priority queue

  1. **Algorithms** : Functions for processing sequences of elements from containers. (find, max, count, accumulate, sort etc)

  1. **Iterators** : Generate sequences of elements from containers. (forward, reverse, by value, by reference, constant etc)

     - Types of iterators provided by STL

       1. Input iterators : from the container to the program.
       1. Output iterators : from the program to the container.
       1. Forward iterators : Navigate one item at a time in one direction.
       1. Bi-directional iterators : Navigate one item at a time both directions.
       1. Random access iterators : Directly access a container item.
