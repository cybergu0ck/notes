## Arithmetic Operators

| Operator | Operation          |
| -------- | ------------------ |
| +        | Addition           |
| -        | Subtraction        |
| \        | Divison            |
| \*       | Multiplication     |
| %        | Modulo (remainder) |

## Assigment Operators

- The left hand side of the assignment operator must be a modifiable lvalue.
- The right hand side of the assignment operator can be either an lvalue or prvalue or an xvalue.

### Compound Assignment Operators

| Operator | Example     | Meaning          |
| -------- | ----------- | ---------------- |
| +=       | lhs += rhs  | lhs = lhs + rhs  |
| -=       | lhs -= rhs  | lhs = lhs - rhs  |
| \*=      | lhs \*= rhs | lhs = lhs \* rhs |
| /=       | lhs /= rhs  | lhs = lhs / rhs  |
| %=       | lhs %= rhs  | lhs = lhs % rhs  |
| >>=      | lhs >>= rhs | lhs = lhs >> rhs |
| <<=      | lhs <<= rhs | lhs = lhs << rhs |
| &=       | lhs &= rhs  | lhs = lhs & rhs  |
| ^=       | lhs ^= rhs  | lhs = lhs ^ rhs  |
| \|=      | lhs \|= rhs | lhs = lhs \| rhs |

## Relational Operators (Comparsion Operators)

Relational operators result to bool types.

| Operator | Operation                    |
| -------- | ---------------------------- |
| ==       | Equal to                     |
| !=       | Not equal to                 |
| >        | Greater than                 |
| >=       | Greater than or equal to     |
| <        | Less than                    |
| <=       | Less than or equal to        |
| <=>      | three way comaprison (C++20) |

## Increment and Decrement Operators

Increases or decreases the value by 1.

### prefix

- Does the increment/decrement first and then the assignment

  ```cpp
  int main()
  {
      int num = 1;
      int new_num = ++num; // num = num + 1 and then new_num = num
      cout << new_num;
      return 0;
  }
  //2
  ```

<br>

### postfix

- Does the assignment first and then the increment/decrement.

  ```cpp
  int main()
  {
      int num = 1;
      int new_num = num++; //new_num = num and then num = num + 1
      cout << new_num;
      return 0;
  }

  //1
  ```

* Check this out

  ```cpp
  int main()
  {
      int num = 1;
      int another = ++num + 10; // num = num + 1 and then another = num + 10;
      std::cout << another << std::endl; //12
      int new_num = num++ + 10; // new_num = num + 10 and then num = num + 1;
      std::cout << new_num << std::endl;  //12
      return 0;
  }
  ```

## Logical Operators

Logical operators result to bool types.

| Operator    | Operation   |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| not (!)     | negation    |
| and (&&)    | logical and |
| or ( \|\| ) | logical or  |

<br>

## Bitwise Operators

<!-- TODO : Complete this part -->

<br>
<br>

## Address of Operator (&)

- & is used as Address of Operator when
- When & is used as the "address-of" operator, as in &variable, it returns a pointer to the memory address of the variable. The resulting data type is a pointer type.

# Operator Precedence

The precendence is tabulated from higher (top ones) to lower (bottom ones)

| Operator                               | Associativity |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| [] -> . ()                             | left to right |
| ++ -- not -(unary) \*(de-ref) & sizeof | right to left |
| \* / %                                 | left to right |
| + -                                    | left to right |
| << >>                                  | left to right |
| < <= > >=                              | left to right |
| == !=                                  | left to right |
| &                                      | left to right |
| ^                                      | left to right |
| \|                                     | left to right |
| &&                                     | left to right |
| \|\|                                   | left to right |
| = op= ?:                               | right to left |
