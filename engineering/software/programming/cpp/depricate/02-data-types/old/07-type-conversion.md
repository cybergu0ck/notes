## Explicit casting


### reinterpret_cast

- This casting operator is the most powerful, but also the most dangerous, as it performs low-level reinterpretation of the bits of an object from one type to another.
- It allows you to convert between unrelated types, such as between pointers and integers, but it should be used sparingly and with a deep understanding of the implications.
- It is also called as C style cast or forced cast.
