# Module

* Every single python file is called a module.  
* The file name is the module name.
* Within a module, the module’s name (as a string) is available as the value of the global variable ```__name__```.
* It is an object that serves as an organizational unit of Python code.  
* Definitions from a module can be imported into other modules or into the main module.

<br>

* Consider the following myPackage for illustration, Here fibo.py and myCode.py are modules. myCode imports fibo module.
    ```
    myPackage
        │   fibo.py
        │   myCode.py
        │   __init__.py
        
    ```

    ```python
    #fibo.py

    def fib(n):    # write Fibonacci series up to n
        a, b = 0, 1
        while a < n:
            print(a, end=' ')
            a, b = b, a+b
        print()

    def fib2(n):   # return Fibonacci series up to n
        result = []
        a, b = 0, 1
        while a < n:
            result.append(a)
            a, b = b, a+b
        return result
    ```


* Import the entire module and use dot notation to access functions
    ```python
    #myCode.py (import v1)

    import fibo
    fibo.fib(4)

    #>0 1 1 2 3 
    ```


* Import particular functions from a module.
    ```python
    #myCode.py (import v2)

    from fibo import fib
    fib(4)

    #>0 1 1 2 3 
    ```


* Import everything from a module. (Not ideal as may result in namespace errors)
    ```python
    #myCode.py (import v3)

    from fibo import *
    fib(4)

    #>0 1 1 2 3 
    ```


* Import the module with an alias.
    ```python
    #myCode.py (import v4)

    import fibo as Fibonacci
    Fibonacci.fib(4)

    #>0 1 1 2 3 
    ```


* Import a function with alias from a module.
    ```python
    #myCode.py (import v5)

    from fibo import fib as Fibonacci
    Fibonacci(4)

    #>0 1 1 2 3 
    ```


>  For efficiency reasons, each module is only imported once per interpreter session. ___Therefore, if you change your modules, you must restart the interpreter___ – or, if it’s just one module you want to test interactively, use importlib.reload(), e.g. import importlib; importlib.reload(modulename).

# Package

- Packages are a way of structuring Python’s module namespace by using “dotted module names”. ___Package is essentially a collection of modules.___
- Technically, a package is a Python module with a ```__path__``` attribute.


 * ***It’s important to keep in mind that all packages are modules, but not all modules are packages.*** Or put another way, packages are just a special kind of module. Specifically, any module that contains a ```__path__``` attribute is considered a package.


> * When importing the package, Python searches through the directories on sys.path looking for the package subdirectory.
> * The ```__init__```.py files are required to make Python treat directories containing the file as packages. 
> * In the simplest case, ```__init__```.py can just be an empty file, but it can also execute initialization code for the package or set the ```__all__``` variable

<br>

## Regular Package

A traditional package, such as a directory containing an ```__init__```.py file.

<br>

## Namespace Package

- A PEP 420 package which serves only as a container for subpackages. Namespace packages may have no physical representation, and specifically are not like a regular package because they have no ```__init__```.py file.

- Note that names are case sensitive when importing.

> All names in Python are case-sensitive: variable names, function names, class names, module names, exception names. If you can get it, set it, call it, construct it, import it, or raise it, it's case-sensitive.

<br>
<br>

# Namespaces

- The place where a variable is stored. 
- Namespaces are implemented as dictionaries. 
- There are the local, global and built-in namespaces as well as nested namespaces in objects (in methods). 
- Namespaces support modularity by preventing naming conflicts. For instance, the functions ```__builtins.open__``` and ```__os.open()__``` are distinguished by their namespaces. Namespaces also aid readability and maintainability by making it clear which module implements a function. For instance, writing random.seed() or itertools.islice() makes it clear that those functions are implemented by the random and itertools modules, respectively.

* Consider myPackage for illustration, myPackage is a package containing modules fibo, myCode and subpackages calc and greet.

    ```
    myPackage
        │   __init__.py                     #Initialise myPackage
        │   fibo.py                         #Module
        │   myCode.py                       #Module
        │
        ├───calc                                #Subpackage
        │   │   functions.py
        │   │   __init__.py
        │   
        │
        ├───greet                               #Subpackage
            │   functions.py
            │   __init__.py
        
    ```


    ```python
    #functions module present in calc subpackage

    def sum(*args) -> float:
        res = 0
        for num in args:
            res += num
        return res

    class AdvancedCalc:
        def average(self,*args) -> float:
            sum, nums = 0, len(args)
            for num in args:
                sum += num
            return sum/nums
    ```

    ```python
    #functions module present in greet subpackage

    def sayHello()-> str:
        """returns a greeting string """
        return "Hello user, hope you are doing amazing."
    ```

* Importing the functions submodule present in calc subpackage. It must be referenced with its full name.

    ```python
    #myCode.py 

    import calc.functions
    print(calc.functions.sum(1,2,3))

    >6
    ```

* Importing the submodule without referencing the package prefix.
    ```python 
    #myCode.py  (alternate import)

    from calc import functions
    print(functions.sum(1,2,3))

    >6
    ```

* Try to avoid above kind of import as it may lead to namespace conflicts, as shown below

    ```python
    #myCode.py 
    
    from calc import functions
    from greet import functions

    print(functions.sayHello())
    print(functions.sum(1,2))

    >AttributeError: module 'greet.functions' has no attribute 'sum'
    ```


* Importing the desired function or variable directly:
    ```python 
    ##myCode.py  (alternate import)
    #-----------------------------------------------

    from calc.functions import sum
    print(sum(1,2,3))

    >6
    ```

> * Note that when using ```from package import item```, the item can be either a submodule (or subpackage) of the package, or some other name defined in the package, like a function, class or variable. 
> * The import statement first tests whether the item is defined in the package; if not, it assumes it is a module and attempts to load it. If it fails to find it, an ImportError exception is raised.

# Relative Imports

Just don't use it, refer [stack overflow- how to do relative imports in python](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72852/how-to-do-relative-imports-in-python)

# Import module from different directory using the sys module


* Consider that we want to import something from module.py in main.py from the illustration below:

    ```
    anotherPackage
    │   __init__.py
    │
    ├───subPackage1
    │   │   module.py
    │   │   __init__.py
    │   
    │
    └───subPackage2
        | main.py
        | __init__.py

    ```

    ```python
    #module.py

    def doSomething():
        print("Doing something..")
    ```

    ```python
    #main.py

    import sys
    #print(sys.path)
    #print('\n\n')


    sys.path.append('D:\\Code\\Python\\PythonLearning\\Modules\\anotherPackage\\subPackage1')
    #print(sys.path)

    import module

    module.doSomething()
    ```
