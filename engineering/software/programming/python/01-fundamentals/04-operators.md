# Binary Operators


## `//` operator

- In Python, the // operator is the integer division operator. 
- It returns the [floor](python-numbers.md#mathfloor) of the quotient when one integer is divided by another.

```python
print(3//2)
print(-3//2)

#>1
#>-2
```

## Bitwise Operators 


| Symbol | Operator |
|---|---|
| & | bitwise AND |
| \| | bitwise OR |
| ~ | bitwise NOT |
| ^ | bitwise XOR |
| << | bitwise Left Shift |
| >> | bitwise Right Shift |

<br/>

### Bitwise AND (&)
---
* Decimal 5 is Binary 0101. (5 is 0b0101)
* Decimal 6 is Binary 0110. (6 is 0b0110)
* 5 & 6 should give 0b0100 which is 4 (Perform AND bit by bit)

```python
print(5 & 6)

>4
```

We can use the `bin()` to get binary string of any decimal number.
```python
print(bin(5 & 6))

>0b100
```

<br/>

### Bitwise OR ( | )
---
Exactly same like AND but instead performs OR.

<br/>

### Bitwise NOT (~)
---
Invert all the 1's to 0's and 0's to 1's.

Important points:

> ***Computers store negative numbers in 2's compliment form ([Twos complement: Negative numbers in binary - Ben Eater](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qH4unVtJkE&ab_channel=BenEater))***
> 
> Hence, 
> 1. to find the decimal equivalent of a negative binary number (i.e. if MSB = 1), get the 2's compliment
> 2. To find the binary bits for a negative decimal number, also get the 2's compliment.

* It is crucial to know how many bits does the language (compiler or interpreter) use to represent numbers, As this will determine the position of the Most Significant Bit (MSB)
* MSB will determine if the number is positive (MSB = 0) or negative (MSB = 1)
* Python uses 32 bits to represent integers.

Explanation for how it is (-6) in Base 10 is as follows:

## Bitwise XOR (^)
---
Performs XOR operation bitwise.  XOR operation follows : `A ^ B = A * B' + A' * B` and its truth table is shown below

| A    | B | A^ B |
|---|-- |---|
|0 | 0 | 0|
|0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1| 0| 1| 
|1| 1| 0|

Illustration:
5 is 0b0101 and 1 is 0b0001, Performing Bitwise XOR results in 0b0100 which is 4.

```python
print(5^1)

>4
```

<br/>

## Bitwise Left Shift (<<)
---
Shift the bits in the Left Side (In binary) of the operator by the number (in decimal) present in Right Side of the operator

5 is 0b0101, Hence for `5 << 3` we must shift the bits in binary of 5 by 3 places, gives us 0b_0010_1000 (In Python, underscores are used to group digits without messing with the magnitude of the number). 0b_0010_1000 is 40

```python
print(5 << 3)

>40
```

## Bitwise Right Shift
---
Same concept as Left Shift but Shift Right Instead.
