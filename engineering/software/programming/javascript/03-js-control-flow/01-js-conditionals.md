# If Else statement

```js
let num = 2;

if (num % 2 === 0) {
  console.log(`${num} is an even number.`);
} else {
  console.log(`${num} is an odd number.`);
}

//2 is an even number.
```

<br>
<br>

# Else if statement

```js
let num = 3;

if (num % 2 === 0) {
  console.log(`${num} is an even number.`);
} else if (num % 2 !== 0) {
  console.log(`${num} is an odd number.`);
}

//3 is an odd number.
```

> We can use logical operators like && (and) and || (or) inside paranthesis of if and else if conditions.

# Ternary conditional operator

```js
let num = 10;
let res =
  num % 2 === 0 ? `${num} is an even number.` : `${num} is an odd number.`;
console.log(res);

//10 is an even number.
```

### Multiple Ternary conditional operators

```js
let age = 2;

let greeting =
  age < 5
    ? `Hi baby`
    : age < 18
    ? `Hello!`
    : age < 100
    ? "Greetings"
    : "Wow, going strong";

console.log(greeting);
//Notice how it terminates after a condition is satisfied.

// Hi baby
```
