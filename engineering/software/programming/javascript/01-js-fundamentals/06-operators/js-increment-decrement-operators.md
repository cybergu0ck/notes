## Prefix and Postfix

- In Prefix increment/decrement happens first and then the assignment. Hence the operation occurs first and the value (new in this case) is returned.

- In Postfix assignment happens first and then the increment/decrement. Hence the value (old in this case) is returned and then the operation occurs.
