# Template Literals

Template literals facilitate the use of javascript inside strings.

```js
const book = "The Alchemist";
const author = "Paulo Coelho";
const myTemplateLiteral = `${author} is the author of the ${book}.`;
console.log(myTemplateLiteral);

// Paulo Coelho is the author of the The Alchemist.
```
