# Nodejs

**_Node.js is an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime environment._**

- Node.js runs the V8 JavaScript engine, Google Chromeâ€™s core, outside the browser.
- A Node.js app runs in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request.
- It is open source and cross-platform.
