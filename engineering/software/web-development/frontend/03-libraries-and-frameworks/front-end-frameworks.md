## Front-end Terminology

### Declarative Approach

It refers to a programming paradigm or style where the dev describes what he wants to achieve, rather than specifying the exact step-by-step instructions for how to achieve it.

<br>

### Opinionated

It is the idea that there is set of strong, pre-defined principles, conventions and best practices that is to be followed by developers.

<br>

### Batteries included

It is the idea that most of the requirements are provided as ready-to-use components or funcitonality out of the box.

## Front-end Framework

_"**Front-end framework**" is a comprehensive, reusable code and guidelines to develop the UI of the web application._

- Front-end Frameworks are mostly "opinionated".
- Front-end Frameworks are "batteries included".
- Examples are:

  - Angular
  - Vue
  - Svelte
  - Next (Opionated Framework based on React Library)

<br>
<br>

## Front-end Library

_"**Front-end Library**" is a collection of reusable code for specific aspects of developping the UI of the web application._

- Front-end Frameworks are mostly **not** "opinionated".
- Front-end Frameworks are **not** "batteries included".

- Examples are :
  - React
  - Axios
  - Lodash

### Need for front-end frameworks and libraries

An interactive webpage is all about handling the data and displaying the webpage accordingly. This means that the data and the UI must be in sync.

- Using Vanilla Javascript (or JQuery) to do the above is not ideal for the following reasons:

    <ol type="1">
        <li> Requires a lot of DOM manipulation and traversing (imperative).</li>
        <li> Results in Spaghetti code!</li>
        <li>  Data is usually stored in the DOM (which is shared across the entire app), hard to reason and solve bugs.</li>
    </ol>

- In addition to solving the above mentioned drawbacks, the front-end frameworks provide:

    <ol type="1">
        <li> A correct way of structuring and writing code.</li>
        <li> Gives developers and teams a consistent way of building applications.</li>
    </ol>

# Single Page Application

_A **Single Page Application (SPA)** is a web application that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current page, rather than loading entire new pages from the server._

- SPA are executed entirely on the client.
- The page is never reloaded.
