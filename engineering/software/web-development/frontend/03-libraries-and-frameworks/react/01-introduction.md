# React

React is a front-end library that is used to build UI for web applications.

- React is State-driven. React **_"reacts"_** to state changes by re-rendering the UI.
- React is [Declarative](../front-end-frameworks.md#declarative-approach). We tell it what a component should look like using JSX.
- React is a [Library](../front-end-frameworks.md#front-end-library) and not [Framework](../front-end-frameworks.md#front-end-framework) as it is only the "view" layer.
- React is **not** [Opinionated](../front-end-frameworks.md#opinionated).
- React (just the library) is **not** [Batteries Included](../front-end-frameworks.md#batteries-included).
