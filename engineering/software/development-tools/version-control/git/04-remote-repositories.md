# Remote Repo

## Connecting to remote repo

- Connecting a local git repo to a remote repo provides lot of benefits.
- A git repo that is cloned is connected by default.
- A git repo that is initialised locally can be connected to a remote one.

- We can do this by using

  ```bash
  git remote add <name> <remote-repo-url>
  ```

  - `name` is the alias given to the remote repo, so that we can refer to the remote repo using the alias instead of the url! origin is the general alias name.
  - `remote-repo-url` must be found from the PaaS (GitHub).

## Viewing the associated remote repo

Once a remote repo is connected to the local repo, it's details can be checked using

```bash
git remote --verbose
```

<br>
<br>

## Fetching updates from the remote repo

git fetch updates the local references to the remote branches without making changes to the working directory and moving the HEAD.

## Pulling the updates from the remote repo

git pull fetches and merges the updates from the remote repo.

When working with multiple branches, git pull will fetch changes from the remote repository for all branches but it will only merge the changes into the currently checked-out branch.

## Working with remote branches

- To list the remote branches, use:

  ```bash
  git branch -r
  ```

- To create a local branch that tracks remote branch, use:

  ```bash
  git checkout -b <local-branch-name> <remote_name>/<remote-branch-name> # git checkout -b bugfix1.2 origin/bugfix1.2
  ```

  - Note that the name of the local branch and the remote branch in the above case must be same, else a new branch will be created in remote repo when the changes are pushed.

- To push update to the remote branch

  ```bash
  git push <remote-name> <local-branch-name> #git push origin bugfix1.2
  ```

- To pull updates for the remote branch.

  ```bash
  git pull <remote-name> <local-branch-name> #git pull origin bugfix1.2
  ```

- To delete a remote branch on the remote repo, use:

  ```bash
  git push <remote-name> --delete <branch-name> #git push origin --delete bugfix1.2
  ```

- To rename a remote branch:

  - Rename the current branch locally:
    ```
    git branch -m <new-branch-name>
    ```
  - Delete the remote branch containing the old name:

    ```
    git push <remote-name> --delete <branch-name>
    ```

  - Reset the upstream branch for the branch containing the new name:
    ```
    git push origin -u <new-branch-name>
    ```
