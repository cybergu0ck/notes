## Number of permutations to make change

- Permutation is the method of selecting items from a set where order is important. Checkout math notes for example.
- Illustration: Given the denominations in terms of coins, [1,3,5,10], The number of permutations to make change of 4 is 3. Specifically (1,1,1,1),(1,3),(3,1).
- Using our framework:

  1. The base case is F(0) = 1, There is 1 way to make change for 0, i.e. by choosing no coins.
  2. Solving couple more base cases like this, for example F(4), we can either choose 1 and then we need to compute the number of ways to make change for 3 i.e. F(3) or we can choose 3 and then compute F(1). Thus, F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-3) + F(n-5) + F(n-10). In general, F(n) = sum(F(n-j)) where j is the items in coins.

### Using Recursion

```py
def makeChange(target, coins):
    def dfs(cursum):
        if cursum == 0:
            return 1
        num_ways = 0
        for coin in coins:
            if cursum >= coin:
                num_ways += dfs(cursum - coin)
        return num_ways

    return dfs(target)


coins = [1,3,5,10]
target = 4
print(makeChange(target, coins))
#3
```

- This is a Top Down Approach as we start from the given target.

### Using Recursion with Memoization

- Avoiding recalculation for overlapping (repeating) subproblems using cache.

  ```py
  def makeChange(target, coins):
      cache = {}
      def dfs(cursum):
          if cursum == 0:
              return 1
          if cursum in cache:
              return cache[cursum]
          num_ways = 0
          for coin in coins:
              if cursum >= coin:
                  num_ways += dfs(cursum - coin)
          cache[cursum] = num_ways
          return num_ways

      return dfs(target)


  coins = [1,3,5,10]
  target = 4
  print(makeChange(target, coins))
  #3
  ```

<br>

### Using Dynamic Programming

- This is a Bottom up Approach.

  ```py
  def makeChange(target, coins):
      dp = [0 for amount in range(target+1)]
      dp[0] = 1 #There is one way of making change for 0 that is by choosing no coins

      for amount in range(1, target+1):
          for coin in coins:
              if amount >= coin:
                  dp[amount] += dp[amount-coin]
      return dp[target]


  coins = [1,3,5,10]
  target = 4
  print(makeChange(target, coins))
  #3
  ```

## Number of combinations to make change

- Combinations is the method of selecting items from a set where order is not important. Checkout math notes for example.
- Illustration: Given the denominations in terms of coins, [1,3,5,10], The number of permutations to make change of 4 is 3. Specifically (1,1,1,1),(1,3).

```py
def makeChange(target, coins):
    def dfs(cursum, index):
        if cursum == 0:
            return 1
        num_ways = 0
        for c in range(index,-1,-1):
            if cursum>=coins[c]:
                num_ways += dfs(cursum-coins[c],c)
        return num_ways

    return dfs(target, len(coins)-1)


coins = [1, 2, 3, 5]
target = 75
print(makeChange(target, coins))
```
