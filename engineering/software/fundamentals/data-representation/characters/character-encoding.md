# ASCII

ASCII is a character encoding standard for electronic communication.

- Its primary purpose was to standardize the representation of alphanumeric characters, punctuation marks, and control characters.
- ASCII stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange.
- Standard ASCII uses 7 bit encoding i.e uses 7 bits to represent 128 characters (2^7 = 128).
- Extended ASCII is another standard utilizing 8 bit encoding.
