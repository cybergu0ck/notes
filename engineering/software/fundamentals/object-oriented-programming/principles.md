## coupling

coupling refers to the degree to which two software components are independent of each other.

- when components are loosely coupled, it means that changes to A is less likely to affect B and vice versa.
- when components A and B are completely decoupled, it means that changes to A won't affect B and vice versa.

- advantages of loosely coupling or decoupling :

  1. reduced dependancy : components do not rely on the implementation details of each other and only interacts with each other through well defined interfaces.
  1. increased modularity : decoupled components are independant components.
  1. improved maintainability
  1. enhanced testability : components can be tested in isolation.
