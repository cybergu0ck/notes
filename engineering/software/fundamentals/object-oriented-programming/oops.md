## Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the concept of wrapping up information and behaviour and managing (allowing or restricting) access to it.

<br>
<br>

## Abstraction

Abstraction is the concept of hiding complexity and exposing the necessary.

<br>
<br>
<br>

## Inheritance

Inheritance is the mechanism by which a class can acquire and extends properties and behaviors from another class.

### Difference between abstract class and interface

| Abstarct class                                   | Interface                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Represents base class with shared implementation | Represents a pure contract                           |
| Models an "is a" relation                        | Defines what a class "must do"                       |
| Contains partial implementation                  | Contains no implementation (purely abstract methods) |
| Objects can be instantiated                      | Objects cannot be instantiated                       |

- In C++
  - An interface is implemented as a class with only purely virtaul functions as it does not have a specific keyword for `interface`.
  * An abstract class is a class with at least one pure virtual function.
