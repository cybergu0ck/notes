# Shell

The **shell** is a program that takes  keyboard commands and passes them to the operating  system to carry out.

* *sh* is the original Unix shell program written by Steve Bourne.
* *bash* is the enhanced version of sh (bash for bourne again shell) and all distros supply bash from the GNU project.

# Terminal Emulators

* When using a graphical user interface, Terminal emulators give us access to the shell.
    - KDE uses "konsole" 
    - GNOME uses "gnome-terminal", though it’s likely called simply “terminal” on our menu

* Shell Prompt : starts with `username@machinename`, followed by the current working directory and a dollar sign.
 
* If the last character of the prompt is a hash mark (#) rather than a dollar sign ($), the terminal session has superuser privileges which means that either we are logged in as the root user or we’ve selected a terminal emulator that provides superuser (administrative) privileges.

# About mouse and focus

A mechanism built into the X Window System (the underlying engine that makes the GUI go) supports a quick copy-and-paste technique. 

- If you highlight some text by holding down the left mouse button and 
dragging the mouse over it (or double-clicking a word), it is copied into a buffer maintained by X. Pressing the middle mouse button will cause the text to be pasted at the cursor location.

 - Don’t be tempted to use CTRL-C and CTRL-V to perform copy and paste 
inside a terminal window. They don’t work.
