# Git Merging

Merging refers to the process of incorporating the changes made in one branch into another.

- Being in the branch where another branch has to be merged, The following command must be used with the name of the branch to be merged into the current branch.

  ```
  git merge <branch-name> #the mentioned branch will be merged into the current branch
  ```

<br>
<br>

## Types of merges

<br>

### Fast Forward Merge

### Squash Merge

Squash merge squashes all the commits from the source branch into one commit in the target branch.

1. Checkout the target branch (the branch to merge into).
2. Merge the branch using squash option, this will not create any new commit, it simply gets the changes.

   ```bash
   git merge --squash <branch>
   ```

3. Commit the changes with an appropraite message.

### Rebase

Follow these steps to rebase a current branch (ex: feature) to target branch (ex: main):

1. Make sure to be in the branch that needs to be rebased to the target branch.

   ```bash
   git switch <current-branch-name> #git switch feature1.2
   ```

1. Use the following command to rebase the current branch to the target branch.

   ```bash
   git rebase <target-branch> #git rebase main
   ```

1. If any merge conflicts occur, resolve them like resolving any other merge conflict (Below in this note).

## Merge Conflicts

- Merge conflicts occur when git is unable to automatically combine changes from different branches due to conflicting modifications in the same part of a file or conflicting changes in file renames or deletions.

- It is ideal to use an external merge tool to resolve merge conflicts. VS code's latest three way merge editor looks nice. Set it in the .gitconfig as shown in customizations file.

### Resolving merge conflicts using merge tool

Follow these steps when merge conflict occurs:

1. Launch the mergetool using the git command:

   ```bash
   git mergetool
   ```

2. Resolve the conflict in the merge tool editor and save (Ctrl + S) the tab.
3. Finish the merging by commiting.
   ```bash
   git commit -m "appropriate commit message"
   ```

<br>

### Resolving merge conflicts without merge tool

Follow these steps when merge conflict occurs:

1. Resolve the merge conflict manually.
1. Stage the appropriate files.
   ```bash
   git add <file(s)>
   ```
1. Finish the merging by commiting.

   ```bash
   git commit -m "appropriate commit message"
   ```

## Abort a merge

- Ongoing merge process can be aborted using this command.
  ```bash
  git merge --abort
  ```

<br>
