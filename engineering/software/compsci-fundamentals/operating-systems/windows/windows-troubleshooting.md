# Insert Mode and Overwrite Mode

- If the cursor is set to verticle line(|), Then it is in **_insert_** mode.

  - It is the default mode
  - All text you type will force the rest of the line to move further.

- If the cursor is set to an underscore (\_), Then it is in **_overwrite_** mode.

  - It is enabled by pressing the `Insert` key.
  - meaning that anything you type will overwrite the text at the cursor position.

- Generally this is altered when 0 is pressed when NumLock is disabled, which enables `Insert` mode!

- `Insert` key toggles the modes!
