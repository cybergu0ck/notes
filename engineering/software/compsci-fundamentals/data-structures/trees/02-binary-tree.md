### Maximum number of nodes for a given height

<div style="height: 1px; background-color: #808080;"></div>

The maximum number of nodes at a given height $h$ is $2^h$. The maximum number of nodes at a given height can be calculated by summing up all the nodes at respective height's i.e $2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + ... + 2^h$. This is a geometric series and the sum of a geometric series is given by the formula:

$$ S = a \left( \frac{1- r^n }{1- r } \right)$$

In our case, $a = 2^0$, $r = 2$ and $n = h+1$. Therefore,

$$ S = 2^{h+1} -1 $$

Hence, For a tree with height $h$,

$$ \text{The maximum number of nodes in the tree} = N = 2^{h+1} -1 $$

<br>

### Height of the tree for number of nodes

<div style="height: 1px; background-color: #808080;"></div>

If $N$ is the maximum number of nodes and $h$ is the height of the tree, we know that ([proof](#maximum-number-of-nodes-for-a-given-height)) :

$$ N = 2^{h+1} -1 $$

Solving for h in the above equation,

$$ h = \log_2{(N+1)}-1 $$

Hence, For a tree with $N$ nodes,

$$ \text{The height of the tree = h =} floor(log_2(N))$$

### Indices when represented as an array

<div style="height: 1px; background-color: #808080;"></div>

When the tree is represented as an zero indexed array, for node at index $i$,

- Index of left child = $2\times{i}+1$.
- Index of right child = $2\times{i} +2$
- Index of parent = $floor((i-1)/2)$

## Types of Binary Tree

<br>

### Types of Binary Tree based on number of children

<div style="height: 1px; background-color: #808080;"></div>

<br>

#### Full Binary Tree

_A full binary tree is a special type of binary tree in which every node other than the leaves has exactly two children._

![full-binary-tree](./_assets/full-binary-tree.png)

<br>

#### Degenerate Binary Tree

_A degenerate binary tree is a type of binary tree in which each parent node has only one associated child node._

![degenerate-binary-tree](./_assets/degenerate-binary-tree.png)

- Also known as a pathological tree or a skewed tree.
- They are esentially a linked list.

<br>
<br>

### Types of Binary Tree based on completion levels

<div style="height: 1px; background-color: #808080;"></div>

<br>

#### Perfect Binary Tree

_A perfect binary tree is a type of binary tree in which all interior nodes have exactly two children and all leaf nodes are at the same level or depth._

![perfect-binary-tree](./_assets/perfect-binary-tree.png)

- Perfect binary trees have precisely $(2^k) - 1$ nodes, where k is the last level of the tree (starting with 1).
- Perfect binary tree is a balanced binary tree where every level is filled with the maximum number of nodes possible.
- A perfect binary tree is always complete binary tree.

<br>

#### Complete Binary Tree

_A complete binary tree is a type of binary tree in which all levels of the tree are completely filled except possibly for the last level, which is filled from left to right._

![complete-binary-tree](./_assets/complete-binary-tree.png)

- A complete tree is not always perfect tree.

- This is a complete binary tree.

  ```
            20
          /    \
        18      12
       / \
      9   7

  ```

- This is NOT a complete binary tree. As it is not left leaning when possible.

  ```
            20
          /    \
        18      12
       / \        \
      9   7        1

  ```

<br>

#### Balanced Binary Tree

_A balanced binary tree is a type of binary tree in which the heights of the left and right subtrees of every node differ by at most one._

## Tree Traversal Algorithms

Tree traversal algorithms are the only algorithms relevant to binary tree, algorithms to perform operations like searching, inserting or deleting a node is not relevant to binary tree as there is no criteria unlike that of [binary search tree property](03-binary-search-tree.md#binary-search-tree-property).

#### In Order Traversal

_Inorder traversal is a depth-first tree traversal algorithm that visits the left subtree, then the current node, and finally the right subtree_

- In Order Traversal : 4, 2, 5, 1, 6, 3, 7

<br>

#### Pre Order Traversal

_Preorder traversal is a depth-first tree traversal algorithm that visits the current node, then the left subtree, and finally the right subtree._

- Pre Order Traversal : 1, 2, 4, 5, 3, 6, 7

<br>

#### Post Order Traversal

_Postorder traversal is a depth-first tree traversal algorithm that visits the left subtree, then the right subtree, and finally the current node._

- Post Order Traversal : 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 3, 1

<br>

#### Level Order Traversal

_Level order traversal, also known as breadth-first traversal, visits nodes level by level from left to right, starting from the root level and moving to deeper levels._

- Level Order Traversal : 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
