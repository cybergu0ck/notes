# Tree

_Tree is a nonlinear hierarchial data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges._

## Basics of Tree

### Elements of Tree

1. **_Node_** : Entity that contains a value and pointers to it's children nodes.

1. **_Edge_** : Link between nodes.

1. **_Root_** : Top most node of a tree.

1. **_Leaf/Terminal Node_** : A node without children

<br>

### Features of Tree

1. **_Height_** of a node is the number of edges from the node to the deepest leaf.

   - Height is measured from the bottom.
   - Height of the tree is the number of edges from the root to the deepest leaf.
   - In the above image, the height of node J is 0, node D is 2 and the height of the entire tree is 3.

1. **_Depth_** of a node is the number of edges from the node to the root.

   - Depth is measured from the top.
   - Depth of the tree is the number of edges from the root to the deepest leaf. (For the tree, height and depth are same in magnitude)
   - In the above image, the depth of node A is 0, of node H is 2 and node J is 3

## Types of Trees

1. Binary Trees
   <ol type="1">
   <li>Full Binary Trees</li>
   <li>Complete Binary Trees</li>
   <li>Perfect Binary Trees</li>
   </ol>

1. Binary Search Trees (BST)
1. AVL Trees
1. B-Tree
