# Infix expressions

* Infix notation is how expressions are written and recognised by humans and is generally how expressions are entered in programs.
* The opertor is placed between the two operands.
* Example: a+b/c-d

# Postfix expressions

* Computers uses postfix notation to evaluate expressions.
* Every operator follows all its operands.
* Example: abc/+d-

# Conversion of infix to postfix expression

* stack is used to convert an infix expression to postfix expression.
