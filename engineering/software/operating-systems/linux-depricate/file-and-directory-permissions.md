## Using `ls -l`

`ls -l` gives us the long listing of the files and directories.

```bash
ls -l
```

```
total 12
drwxrwxr-x 2 batpi batpi 4096 Feb 15 16:41 dir1
drwxrwxr-x 2 batpi batpi 4096 Feb 15 16:41 dir2
drwxrwxr-x 2 batpi batpi 4096 Feb 15 16:41 dir3
-rw-rw-r-- 1 batpi batpi    0 Feb 15 16:41 file1.txt
```

<br/>

The first letter tells us if it is a directory or a file, 
- If the first letter is 'd' then it is referring to a directory.
- If it is '-' then it is referring to a file.
- If it is 'l' then it is referring to links.

```syntax
	drwxrwxr-x  2  batpi  batpi 4096 Feb 15 16:41 dir1
	|           |    |      |     |    |      |     |  
	|           |    |      |     |    |      |     Name of the directory/file
	|           |    |      |          Date   Time
	|           |    |      Group
	|           |    User  
	|          
	|
	--premission string
```

The first string in every line is the permission string. Understanding it more,

```
d rwx   rwx   r-x
  |     |     |
  |     |     Permission for others
  |     |
  |      Permission for Group
  |
  Permission for User
```
- 'r' means Read the contents of the directory or a file
- 'w' means Write 
- 'x' means Execute
	- If it were a file, 'x' means it can be be executed.
	- If it were a directory, 'x' means we can go into that directory.

## Changing permissions using `chmod`

```bash
chmod  <entity>   <add or remove>  <permission type>  <file/directory>
```
- entity can be 
	- 'u' for user
	- 'g' for group
	- 'o' for others
- add or remove:
	- '+' for add
	- '-' for remove
- permission type:
	- 'r' for Read
	- 'w' for Write
	- 'x' for Execute

<br/>

Few examples to make it concrete,
- Giving user the permission to execute the file called testfile.txt
	```bash
	chmod u+x testfile.txt
	```
- Removing user's permission to enter into a directory called dangerous-dir
	```bash
	chmod u-x dangerous-dir
	```
- Giving user full permissions and removing all permissions for groups and others
	```bash
	chmod go-rwx file1.txt
	```

## Permissions in the form of bits

rwx can be referred to 2^2 , 2^1, 2^0 i.e. 4,2,1 respectively.
- 7 means rwx
- 4 means r--
- 2 means -w-
- 1 means --x
- 5 means r-x
- 3 means -wx
- 6 means rw-
- 0 means ---

## Changing ownership using `chown`

```bash
sudo chown <new_owner> <file/directory>
```

- change ownership of file nuke-code from current owner (has sudo previlledges) to user called batman
	```bash
	sudo chown batman nuke-code
	```
- We can recursively do 
	```bash
	sudo chown -R batman nuke-dir
	```
