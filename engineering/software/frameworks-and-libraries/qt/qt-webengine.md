# WebEngineView

**_QWebEngineView is a widget that allows you to display web content in a Qt application._**

- It is based on the Chromium engine, which is the same engine used by the Google Chrome browser. This allows Qt applications to embed a fully functional web browser or display HTML content within their user interfaces.
