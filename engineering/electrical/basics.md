# Live, Neutral and Ground

- The Live wire is either at high posivite or negative voltage.
- The Neutral wire is mostly maintained at voltage close to ground.
- The Ground wire is generally connected to the body of the applicance, it offers a least resistance path for the current to flow if there were any fault or leakage in the appliance.

## Why is the Ground Pin in electrical plugs are longer than Live and Neutral pins?

It is so because whenever the plug is inserted or removed, the longer earth wire contacts first and ensures safety!

## Why is Neutral wire relatively safer than Live wire

It is because whenever a body comes in contact with the live wire, it is either at a higher or lower potential and in both cases charges will flow through the body creating a shock. Neutral wires are most likely at ground voltage (Not necessarily).
