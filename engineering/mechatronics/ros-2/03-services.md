Services are another method of communication for nodes in the ROS graph. Services are based on a call-and-response model, versus topicsâ€™ publisher-subscriber model. While topics allow nodes to subscribe to data streams and get continual updates, services only provide data when they are specifically called by a client.

There can be many service clients using the same service But there can only be one service server for a service.
