## Geometric series

Geometric series is the sum of the terms of a [geometric sequence](./sequences.md#geometric-sequence).

$$a + ar + ar^2 + ar^3 + \ldots +  a r^{n-1} $$

The $n^{th}$ term of a geometric sequence with the first term as $a$ and the common ratio as $r$ is

$$a_n = a r^{n-1}$$

The sum of the first n terms (finite geometric series)

$$
S_n = \begin{cases} a*n  \quad \text{if r=1}  \\   a\left(\frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r}\right) \quad \text{otherwise} \end{cases}
$$

The sum of an infinite geometric series (for |r| < 1)

$$ S = \frac{a}{1 - r} $$

- Note that the formulas will change if the $n^{th}$ term is reprsented differently.
