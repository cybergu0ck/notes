# The Metamorphosis, Frank Kafka

Gregor Samsa wakes up not as a human but something else like an insect, a bug, a monstorous one. He works as a travelling salesperson, to repay his parent's debts. He is a good and hard working person. Instead of contemplating how he came into this kind of situation, he is worrying about being late to work. He struggles for hours to get out of bed until when the genral manager of the company he is working shows up at the door. The general manager is ruthless, he falsly accuses Gregor's work ethics in front of his parents who try to defend his innocense. Gregor is locked in his room when all of this is happening, others keep asking him to open the door which he does when the general manager is brutally persistant. All are shocked when they see Gregor in his current form, the general manager flees but Gregor is seen convincing him that he'll be back to work somehow only for his father to shove him back into the room. His sister seems to take good care of Gregor, serving him his favourite milk and cleaning the room. Although he disliked food, couldn't consume any of it and hid himself beneath the settee whenever anyone entered his room. Nobody in the family wanted to remain home alone and leaving the house unattended was out of the question while Gregor had many sleepless hungry nights but his only concern had been to remedy the state of utter hopelesness brought to the family as he was the only financial provider for the family and he secretly planned to send his sister to the conservatory the next year.

## Alienation

"When Gregor Samsa woke up one morning from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a gigantic insect. He was lying on his back as hard as armor, and when he lifted his head a little he saw his belly glazed with a yellowish cast and his many legs, pitifully thin compared to the rest of his bulk, flickering helplessly before his eyes."

- The opening vividly illustrates Gregor's physical transformation — an immediate, visceral symbol of alienation from his human condition and self-identity.

<br>

"For two days, every mealtime was spent deliberating how the family should now comport itself; but even between the meals this same discussion continued, for at least two members of the household were present at all times, since apparently no one wanted to reamin at home alone, and of course leaving the appartment unattended was out of the question."

- The family treats him like an alien.

## Isolation

"I am a cage, in search of a bird."

- This metaphor poignantly encapsulates Gregor’s sense of confinement and longing for freedom.

<br>

"I cannot make you understand. I cannot make anyone understand what is happening inside me. I cannot even explain it to myself."

- A profound expression of existential isolation, where Gregor feels completely misunderstood and disconnected even from his own inner world.

<br>

"In order to spare her even this sight, one day he carried the bedsheet over to the settee on his back this labor cost him four hours and arranged it in such a way that he was now completely covered, so that his sister would not be able to see him even if she bent down"

- This line represents isolation because of absurdity.

<br>

## Existentialism

"The meaning of life is that it stops."

- Existentialism is the philosophical viewpoint that one is responsible for creating purpose or meaning in life. The above line is Frank Kafka's meaning about life.

## Crtitique on modern society

"What a fate: to be condemned to work for a firm where the slightest negligence at once gave rise to the gravest suspicion!"

- Gregor wakes up as a bug like creature and first thing he is worried about is him being late to work.
- Kafka seems to be criticizing a society that devalues the human beyond their economic function. Gregor’s inability to think about his own health first indicates the extent to which individual identity is reduced to work-related duties, and how personal suffering can be overlooked or even ignored in such a system.

## Virtues of Gregor Samsa

1. Responsibility, Devotion and Sacrifice.

   "And so he began to work with consuming energy and was promoted, almost overnight, from a minor clerk to a traveling salesman with much greater potential to earn money, and his success was soon transformed, by way of commission, into cash that he could then lay on the table before the astonished and delighted family. Here, Gregor recalls how he rose in the ranks of his company after his parents’ financial ruin. He notes that he never asked his father about the specifics of their financial situation, but immediately got to work and was intent on succeeding. Gregor seems to have been motivated not only by the need for money, but also by the immense pride he felt by providing for his family."

   "If I didn’t hold back for my parents’ sake, I’d have quit ages ago..."

1. Resiliance.

   "Gregor spent the days and nights almost entirely without sleep. Sometimes he mulled over the idea that the next time the door opened he would take control of the family affairs as he had done in the past. Gregor describes the pain he feels when his sister closes the door to his room at night. He fixates on the idea that he should be taking care of his family as he did before, which shows how wrapped up his identity remains with being a provider."

## Grete's character arc

1. Initial Compassion and Caretaker Role:
   At the beginning of Gregor’s transformation, Grete is the only family member who shows consistent pity and care for him. She takes on the responsibility of feeding Gregor, cleaning his room, and trying to make his life as comfortable as possible despite his insect form. Grete acts as Gregor’s primary link to humanity and the family, showing genuine concern and kindness.

1. Growing Responsibility and Maturity:
   As the family struggles financially due to Gregor’s inability to work, Grete matures quickly. She takes a job to help support the family, signaling her transition from a girl to a young woman. She becomes more independent and increasingly assumes adult responsibilities around the household.

1. Increasing Resentment and Distance:
   Over time, caring for Gregor becomes a burden for Grete. Her initial kindness turns into duty, and she grows impatient and frustrated. She becomes more distant and less sympathetic toward Gregor, seeing him less as a brother and more as a problem and obstacle to the family’s well-being.

1. Rejection and Final Break:
   The breaking point comes when Gregor’s presence causes social discomfort for the family, especially after an incident where Gregor frightens the boarders renting part of the house. Grete declares that Gregor must be gotten rid of, no longer viewing him as her brother. This marks a final severance in her relationship with Gregor and symbolizes her full transformation into adulthood, focusing on the family’s future over past attachments.

1. Transformation and New Beginning:
   After Gregor’s death, Grete blossoms into a beautiful young woman. Her parents regard her as ready for marriage, and she symbolizes hope and renewal for the family’s future, completing her arc from a dependent child to a mature adult.

## Strained father-son relationship

The story reflects autobiographical elements, especially Kafka’s troubled relationship with his authoritarian father.

1. Authoritative and Distant Father

   Gregor’s father is depicted as a stern and authoritative figure who once was successful but has become dependent on Gregor’s income. He exercises control within the family, and his demeanor towards Gregor reflects disappointment and a lack of emotional warmth.

1. Shift from Dependence to Resentment

   Before Gregor’s transformation, he financially supported the family, including his father. However, once Gregor becomes incapacitated, their roles reverse in a way—the father reclaims physical dominance and responsibility. This shift breeds resentment. The father’s reaction to Gregor is often aggressive, exemplified when he wounds Gregor with a cane and later throws apples at him. This hostility underscores the degradation of their relationship.

1. Lack of Emotional Connection

   Throughout the story, there is minimal genuine emotional exchange or empathy between father and son.

## Reflection

- Meaning of the book's title.

  - “Metamorphosis” means transformation or change of form, usually implies growth (like a caterpillar to a butterfly). In a sense, all the family members are undergoing metamorphosis as they change to get accustomed to the new situation. But Gregor’s transformation is the opposite : a degeneration, a move away from human life toward meaninglessness while Grete's transformation is indeed a butterfly like metamorphosis. The book titled this is either ironic if we consider Gregor's metamorphosis, or perceptive if one considers Grete's metamorhoposis.

- Is the book about a dark coming-of-age story, where one where growth is bought at the cost of another’s destruction? That the family’s renewal comes only through his decay? Why the contrast one's life ending and another blossoms?

- Like most of the great ones, the book starts with impactful paragraph, of Gregor waking up as a bug. Such a vivid and shocking image grips the reader’s attention instantly.
